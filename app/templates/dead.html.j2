      <p class="movie-description">Movie Description: A dead body and a hotchpotch of homeowners in a residential building on a single night: all hell breaks loose.

As the Jewish axiom has it, “man thinks; God laughs.”

On a night like any other, Ming, together with his wife and mother-in-law, finds an anonymous naked dead body lying at their doorstep. They might not know who the body was, but they have no doubt that their unit will become a “murder home” once this is exposed. Its property value will nosedive, and they will be transformed from blissful homeowners to miserable victims. So they decide to pass the buck to their neighbours.

There are eleven living residents in four units on the same floor. Besides Ming’s family of five, there are the retired elderly couple, Mr. & Mrs. Chan; the single lady Mary and her maid; and the Cheung’s, an irascible father and his cantankerous son. Last but not least, there is this mysterious woman from an upper floor who chain smokes.

This motley group of residents start fighting against one another, striving to wash their own hands off the dead body. But when the day is about to break and nothing has been resolved, they cannot but work together to transport the body away from their building.

This is a story about a dead body, but this is also a story about living people. </p>
